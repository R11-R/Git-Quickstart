### Tutorial

#### 2.1. Git and GitHub

This section will guide you through the process of cloning a repository, adding changes, committing changes, pushing changes, and creating a pull request.

#### 2.1.0. Configure Git

- Open the terminal and run the following commands to configure Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name "<your-name>"
git config --global user.email "<your-email>"
```

These commands will set your name and email for Git. This information will be used to identify you as the author of the changes you make.

Example:

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "JohnDoe@gmail.com"
```

##### 2.1.1. Clone the repository

- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory (also known as folder) where you want to clone the repository.
  - Make sure the path you choose has NO ARABIC LETTERS. This will cause errors.
    - On Mac:

    - On Windows:

- Go to the repository page on **your own account** and click on the green code button.
- Copy the link under the clone section.

- Run the following command inside of the opened terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <The Link from your Repository>
```

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/Selection-Project.git
```

##### 2.1.2. Add changes

- Open the repository directory in VS Code.
  - The path must be INSIDE the cloned repository.
  - Click on File -> Open folder
  ![Alt text](/readme/image21.png)
  - Select the repository folder.
  ![Alt text](/readme/image22.png)
  - The repository should be opened in VS Code.

  - To make sure, run the following command in the terminal INSIDE Vscode:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  - The output should be similar to the following:
  ![Alt text](/readme/image19.png)

- Run the following command to add the changes:

```bash
git add .
```

##### 2.1.3. Commit changes

- Run the following command to commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<commit-message>"
```

##### 2.1.4. Push changes

- Run the following command to push the changes:

```bash
git push
